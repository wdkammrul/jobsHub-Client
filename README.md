⚪ Unique Design: Crafted a visually appealing and unique design for the full-stack Job Seeking website, avoiding any similarities with previous projects or common layouts.

⚪ Responsive Layout: Ensured a seamless experience for users across devices by making the home page responsive for both mobile and desktop views.

⚪ User Authentication: Implemented a secure login and registration system with error messaging, allowing users to access personalized features and maintaining privacy.

⚪ CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for jobs, providing users with the ability to add, edit, and delete their posted jobs.

⚪ Job Filtering and Details: Incorporated a tab system for job categories, allowing users to filter jobs by type. Implemented a private route for job details, ensuring applicants cannot apply after the deadline and employers cannot apply to their own jobs.

⚪ Additional Features: Added two attractive sections on the home page and integrated a filter system for applied jobs based on job categories, enhancing user experience.

⚪ Code Documentation and Readme: Maintained a meaningful folder structure, component names, and route names. Created a comprehensive readme file with a minimum of 18 meaningful git commits on the client-side repository and 8 on the server-side repository.

⚪ Bonus Features: Implemented JWT for two routes, used environment variables to secure sensitive information, and incorporated a reload feature for protected/private routes. Also, explored and implemented a relevant React package (e.g., EmailJs or React-to-Pdf).
